    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: <strong><!-- DATE -->October 17, 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>TradingMa</strong>. Your privacy matters to us. This Privacy Policy explains
      how we handle information when you use our mobile application.
    </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> collect or store sensitive personal information (such as name, email, photos, or location)
      from users directly within the app. We only use a minimal set of technical, non-identifying information necessary
      to run and improve the app, and to serve ads if enabled. Third-party services we use (for example AdMob or Firebase)
      may collect non-personal or device-related information — details below.
    </p>

    <h2>What we do NOT collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not collect your name, address, social security number, payment details, or other highly sensitive personal data.</li>
      <li>We do not access your photos, contacts, SMS, or call logs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What we may collect</h2>
    <p>The app may collect the following categories of information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Technical device information:</strong> device model, OS version, app version, and crash reports (used to fix errors).</li>
      <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> anonymous analytics about how the app is used (screens visited, feature usage) to improve the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising identifiers:</strong> when AdMob or other ad providers are enabled, non-personal advertising identifiers may be used to deliver ads.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-party services</h2>
    <p>
      We may use third-party services such as Google AdMob, Firebase Analytics, or other SDKs. These services have their
      own privacy policies and may collect information independently. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of those services:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Google AdMob and Google Play Services — <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
      <li>Firebase — <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firebase Privacy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How we use the information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To operate and maintain the app.</li>
      <li>To fix crashes and improve performance and user experience.</li>
      <li>To serve advertisements if enabled — ads are provided by third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell personal information. We may share aggregated or anonymized usage statistics with service providers
      that help us operate the app (e.g., analytics providers, ad networks), but such data does not identify you personally.
    </p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>
      Our app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
      If you believe your child provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will take steps to delete it.
    </p>

    <h2>Your choices</h2>
    <p>
      You can control certain app permissions from your device settings (for example, location or storage if requested).
      To opt out of personalized advertising, please follow the instructions in your device settings or the ad provider’s
      privacy preferences.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable steps to protect information collected by the app, but no method is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee
      absolute security of any data.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make changes, we will update the “Last updated” date at
      the top of this page.
