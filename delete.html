  <h1>Account Deletion Information</h1>

  <p>
    TradingMa stores minimal account information (username and password) securely on our servers for authentication purposes.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you uninstall the TradingMa app, your authentication tokens are immediately revoked. 
    This means you will no longer be able to access your account and will stop receiving notifications.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you wish to permanently delete your account and all stored data from our servers, 
    you can contact us at <strong>tradingmacontact@gmail.com</strong>. 
    Once we receive your request, all associated data will be permanently erased.
  </p>

  <p>
    No sensitive personal data (such as payment information or location) is collected or shared with third parties.
